# File Read & Write Program üñãÔ∏è

## Overview
This program reads content from a specified file, modifies it by appending line numbers to each line, and writes the modified content to a new file. It also includes robust error handling to gracefully manage common issues like missing files or permission errors.

## Features
- Reads content from a user-specified file.
- Adds line numbers to the content for better readability.
- Saves the modified content to a new file.
- Provides error handling for:
  - Missing files (`FileNotFoundError`).
  - Read/write permission issues (`IOError`).
  - Unexpected errors (`Exception`).

## Usage
### Prerequisites:
- Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
- The input file must exist in the directory where the program is run.

### Steps to Run:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the Python script: 
   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```
3. Enter the name of the file you wish to read (e.g., `input.txt`).
4. Provide a name for the output file where the modified content will be saved (e.g., `output.txt`).

## Example
**Input File (`input.txt`):**
```
Hello, World!
This is a test file.
File Read & Write Challenge.
```

**After Running the Program:**
**Output File (`output.txt`):**
```
1: Hello, World!
2: This is a test file.
3: File Read & Write Challenge.
```

## Error Handling
- If the specified input file does not exist, the program will display:
  ```
  Error: The file does not exist. Please check the filename and try again.
  ```
- If the program encounters a read/write issue, it will display:
  ```
  Error: Unable to read/write file. Ensure you have the correct permissions.
  ```
- For any unexpected errors, the program provides a friendly message along with the error details.

## Customization
You can customize the program by modifying:
- The logic for altering content (e.g., adding a timestamp instead of line numbers).
- The error messages for specific scenarios.
